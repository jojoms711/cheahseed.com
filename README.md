#### Heatmap - Skills by position (The heatmap compares mean attributes vs 90th percentile attributes of each position.)

Sample observation: The attackers and midfielders share similar key attributes as most of the "hot zones" (dark blue shades) are quite similar in both heatmaps.
Top defenders are more well-rounded compared to general defenders especially in the dribbling, curve, ballcontrol section, which are significantly higher in the 90th percentile heatmap.
