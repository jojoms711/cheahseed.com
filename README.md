### 2. [FIFA 2019 Python Data Science Project](https://github.com/jojoms711/FIFA-2019-data-analysis/blob/master/Project%20code.ipynb)

#### Heatmap - Skills by position (The heatmap compares mean attributes vs 90th percentile attributes of each position.)

Sample observation: The attackers and midfielders share similar key attributes as most of the "hot zones" (dark blue shades) are quite similar in both heatmaps.
Top defenders are more well-rounded compared to general defenders especially in the dribbling, curve, ballcontrol section, which are significantly higher in the 90th percentile heatmap.

#### Spider chart - Skills distribution comparison between the world's Top 3 soccer players

Sample observation: Based on FIFA's index, Cristiano Ronaldo is  more likely to play to his stregnth attributes in a game as he scores higher in the physique related attributes (ie. Heading Accuracy, Shot Power)compared to the L.Messi and  Neymar.

## Work Experience
My specialties include process optimization, data wrangling and visualization, and driving analytics insights for business solutions. I enjoy creating exploratory storyboards from large data sets and developing EDAs from Python and/or SQL queries. 
Please reach out over github for my resume. 
As the Analytics Lead, I collaborate with data engineering team in agile scrum environment on UI design improvements, ETL workflow production process, and onboarding of new data pipeline into the server.
I write a lot of SQL queries and views for data cleaning before creating storyboards on Tableau and excel dashboards. I also lead the analytics team to automate BI dashboards and engage with other teams to re-engineer their process flow using the most cost-efficient tools.
I also anticipate analytic needs and develop proof of concept insights from large data sets for senior management using statistical methods and regression modeling to predict future KPIs.
